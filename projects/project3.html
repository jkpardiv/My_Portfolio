                In response to the growing demand for interactive learning tools and platforms, this project 
                endeavours to develop a dynamic quiz website that facilitates quiz creation and participation. The 
                website's core functionality revolves around the generation of unique Quiz IDs upon quiz creation, 
                enabling seamless participation. Leveraging database connectivity, JSON manipulation, JavaScript 
                programming, and CSS styling, the project aims to create a user-friendly and visually appealing 
                platform. Through intuitive interfaces and robust backend infrastructure, users can create quizzes 
                spanning diverse subjects and engage in interactive learning experiences. The integration of real-time 
                feedback and result tracking enhances user engagement and motivation. This abstract encapsulates 
                the project's objectives, methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, setting the stage for an in-depth 
                exploration of the design, implementation, and conclusions derived from this endeavour.
